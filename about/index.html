      <h1>Journey of a Physicist and Aspiring Developer</h1>
      <h4>Posted by YK</h4>

      <p>
        I studied physics at Reed College (class of ‘10) and started the PhD
        program at the University of Oregon in 2010. At the UofO I was in Prof.
        Eric Corwin’s

          >lab</a

        where I studied the physics of granular materials.
      </p>
      <p>What are granular materials?</p>
      <p>
        Granular materials are exactly what they sound like – a large collection
        of macroscopic objects, like sand at the beach. One of the intriguing
        features of granular matter is its tendency to exhibit
        <a

          href="https://jfi.uchicago.edu/~jaeger/group/JaegerGroupPapers/granular/Granular_RMP.pdf"
        >
          fluid-like and solid-like behavior, depending on ambient conditions</a
        >
        However, unlike conventional liquids and gases, granular systems are not
        sensitive to ambient temperature - they are "athermal."
      </p>
      <p>
        Granular systems also provide a sandbox (pun certainly intended) to
        study emergent behavior in many-bodied systems. We may know the
        properties of an isolated constituent member of a granular system, like
        a grain of sand, but it doesn't explain a lot of their collective
        behavior. Instances of these emergent phenomena in granular systems
        include the Brazil nut effect, the Janssen effect, pattern formation,
        etc.

      <p>Cool, but why should we study these systems?</p>
      <p>
        Intellectual curiosity aside, granular matter is the superset of
        materials like powders, soil, minerals, and so on. In other words, a
        huge chunk of objects we either consume, interact with directly or
        depend on to fuel the economy happen to fall under the category of
        granular materials. So it’s in our best interest to understand the
        physics driving the dynamics of these systems. Further, they also
        provide a test-bed or model system to study other interesting problems
        like the

          href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9409"
          >example</a
        >). You can even get creative and exploit the properties of these
        materials to build things like robotic grippers (see link below).

      <!-- <p>My research projects</p> -->
      <p>
        Roughly speaking, my graduate research focused on two separate projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first project was on the so-called Janssen effect, named after a
        German engineer who was active in the late 19th century. The easiest way
        to understand or explain this is by drawing a comparison to the
        well-known relationship between pressure and the filling height of fluid
        in a container – i.e. pressure <strong>&#x221D;</strong> filling height.
      </p>
      <p>
        In granular systems, the relationship is very different. Turns out, if
        you’re measuring the pressure at the bottom of a tall bucket being
        filled with sand/pebbles/powder/rocks/tennis balls/wood chips/etc. the
        pressure will initially appear to increase with filling height. Nothing
        unexpected. However, beyond some characteristic height (largely
        determined by coefficient of friction, relative size of the bucket) the
        pressure will start plateauing. This is known as the Janssen effect and
        it’s made possible by the formation of contact force networks between
        particles which help divert the increasing load towards the bounding
        walls. For a cool visualization of force networks in granular systems,
        check out the link below!

      <p>
        For my first project I looked at the Janssen effect in 2D and slightly
        different external conditions. The study was an effort to create a
        granular system with tunable effective coefficient of friction. The big
        discovery was the ability to turn the pressure saturation on or off
        based on the container geometry. With the usual Janssen effect “turned
        on” we<a href="#ack" style="text-decoration-line: none;"
          ><sup>*</sup></a
        >
        also found a way to continuously and predictively change the screening
        length at which the saturation kicked in.

        My second project was also related to granular materials, but this time
        I was looking at a completely different phenomenon. In brief, the goal
        of the project was to build an experiment to observe shock fronts in
        flowing granular matter and derive a mathematical model to predict the
        shape of the interface. If you’re super curious, and want more details,

        is behind a pay-wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduate school, I worked for about a year and a half at an
        engineering/consulting firm in Portland, OR where we worked with
        manufacturers and end-users of sonar and navigation systems. My
        responsibilities ranged from technical writing, technical support, data
        analysis, QA testing and some web development work. It was a great
        experience that gave me a taste of the world outside of academia and
        more importantly, made me realize that my passion was in coding. I kept
        gravitating towards projects that involved programming in some capacity
        and eventually concluded that I want to do it professionally. I suddenly
        found myself having to pivot in my career. And this brought me to the
        <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/" target="_blank"
          >Tech Academy</a

        coding boot-camp!

        <a name="ack"><sup>*</sup></a> While I was the only graduate student on
        my projects, none of this would have been possible without the guidance
        of my adviser Eric Corwin, who is one of the sharpest, kindest human
        beings I have encountered. Thank you Eric! But also, discussions with my
        friends in the lab, the department, conversations stemming from
        conference presentations, etc. have had an invaluable impact on the
        direction and nature of my research.
